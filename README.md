# Documentation

## Description

The project was finished using a MERN Stack, React JS as the frontend library, React Redux for state management and React Bootstrap for the UI part. In the backend I used MongoDB as a NoSQL database where I kept all my data, Node JS with Express for creating the server and all routes (e.g create user, update user, delete user etc) for the API. Also, I installed axios for fetching data in the frontent.

## Features

- Any customer can create his own account, using the correct URL ( localhost:3000/register ) or clicking on register button from main page
- After creating an account, you can log in to the app ( localhost:3000/login or clicking to the login button ). If someone logged in, he will be redirected to the main page and see all the content (the content is users only)
- If you want to logout you can do it by clicking the logout button
- If someone is logged in to the app and he is trying to acces the login page he will be pushed back to the main page

```
NOTE: All features related to state management are made with redux
```
